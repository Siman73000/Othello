> **Version:** 1.0  
> **Last Updated:** [2025-12-21]  
> **Applies To:** All community spaces and official project activities (see “Scope”).

## Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, maintainers, and leaders pledge to make participation in our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

We also commit to:
- Practicing respectful disagreement and assuming good intent while staying accountable to impact.
- Making space for people to learn (including newcomers) without tolerating repeated harmful behavior.
- Supporting accessibility and inclusive communication.

---

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment include:
- Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people
- Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
- Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
- Accepting responsibility, apologizing when appropriate, and learning from the experience
- Focusing on what is best for the community, not just for ourselves
- Using welcoming and inclusive language
- Respecting boundaries (time, attention, consent, and personal space)

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:
- The use of sexualized language or imagery, and sexual attention or advances of any kind
- Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
- Public or private harassment, intimidation, or stalking
- Publishing others' private information (e.g., a physical address, private email, phone number, workplace, legal name, or location) without explicit permission (“doxxing”)
- Deliberate misgendering or use of “deadnames”
- Sustained disruption of discussions (e.g., repeatedly derailing threads, spamming, or “sealioning”)
- Encouraging, celebrating, or coordinating any of the above
- Retaliation against people who report or participate in an investigation

> **Note:** Context matters. “I didn’t mean it that way” doesn’t erase harm; we prioritize impact and safety.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces and project-controlled channels, including (but not limited to):
- Source repositories (issues, pull requests, code review comments, commits, wikis)
- Discussion forums, chat servers, social channels, and community calls
- Conferences, meetups, hackathons, and other events run by or officially affiliated with the project
- Direct messages (DMs) and off-platform interactions **when they are initiated through or substantially related to the project**, or when they impact participants’ safety within community spaces

This Code of Conduct also applies when an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces (e.g., using an official email, posting from an official social account, speaking as a representative, or acting as an appointed moderator).

---

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Community leaders (maintainers/moderators) are responsible for:
- Clarifying and enforcing our standards in a consistent and fair manner
- Taking appropriate corrective action in response to behavior that is inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful
- Keeping reports as private as possible while still enabling effective action

Leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned with this Code of Conduct. When reasonable and safe, they will communicate the reasons for moderation decisions.

---

## Reporting

### How to Report
If you experience or witness behavior that violates this Code of Conduct, report it as soon as you feel safe to do so.

- **Primary contact:** [CONTACT_EMAIL]
- **Alternate contact (if the report involves the primary contact or you prefer):** [ALTERNATE_CONTACT]
- **Security-sensitive reports (e.g., credible threats, doxxing):** [SECURITY_EMAIL] (optional)

If you believe there is an immediate risk of physical harm, contact your local emergency services first.

### What to Include (Helpful, Not Required)
- Your name and contact info (or state you want to remain anonymous if possible)
- Date/time and location (link to issue/thread, screenshot, logs)
- What happened and who was involved (usernames, handles)
- Names of witnesses (if any)
- Any safety concerns (e.g., fear of retaliation, ongoing harassment)

### Confidentiality and Privacy
We will handle reports with discretion and share information only with those who need it to respond. We will respect requests for anonymity when possible, though complete anonymity cannot always be guaranteed (e.g., if details uniquely identify a situation).

We may keep internal records of reports and actions for accountability and pattern detection.

### Anti-Retaliation
Retaliation against reporters, witnesses, or enforcement team members is a serious violation and may result in a temporary or permanent ban.

### Knowingly False Reports
Good-faith reports are always welcome—even if they turn out to be mistaken. However, knowingly false or malicious reports may result in corrective action.

---

## Enforcement Process

### Response Expectations
We aim to:
- Acknowledge receipt within **48 hours**
- Provide a status update within **7 days**, when possible

Complex cases may take longer; we will communicate delays when we can.

### Conflict of Interest
If an enforcement team member is reported, has a close personal relationship with a party involved, or otherwise has a conflict of interest, they will recuse themselves. Another maintainer/moderator (or the alternate contact) will handle the case.

### Possible Actions
Actions may include (but are not limited to):
- Removing content, locking threads, or limiting participation in a discussion
- Issuing a warning and setting clear behavioral expectations
- Temporarily restricting participation (time-limited ban)
- Permanently banning a participant from project spaces
- Contacting platform admins when necessary (e.g., GitHub/Discord)
- In severe cases (credible threats, doxxing), escalating to appropriate authorities

---

## Enforcement Guidelines (Community Impact)

Community leaders will follow these Community Impact Guidelines in determining consequences:

### 1. Correction
**Community Impact:** Use of inappropriate language or other behavior deemed unprofessional or unwelcome.  
**Consequence:** A private written warning with clarity about the violation and expectations. A public apology may be requested.

### 2. Warning
**Community Impact:** A single incident or pattern of behavior that violates standards.  
**Consequence:** A formal warning with consequences for continued behavior. May include “no-contact” requirements for a specified period. Continued violations may lead to a temporary or permanent ban.

### 3. Temporary Ban
**Community Impact:** Serious violation, sustained inappropriate behavior, or refusal to comply with moderation.  
**Consequence:** Temporary ban from interaction or public communication for a specified period. Violating the ban may lead to a permanent ban.

### 4. Permanent Ban
**Community Impact:** Pattern of violations, sustained harassment, or aggression toward/disparagement of classes of individuals.  
**Consequence:** Permanent ban from any public interaction within the community.

---

## Appeals

If you believe a moderation decision was made in error, you may appeal by emailing **[APPEALS_EMAIL]** (or [ALTERNATE_CONTACT]) within **30 days** of the decision.

Appeals should include:
- The decision being appealed
- Why you believe it was incorrect or disproportionate
- Any additional context or evidence

Appeals will be reviewed by maintainers/moderators not directly involved in the original decision, when possible. Decisions after appeal are final.

---

## Moderation Notes (Optional but Recommended)

To keep community spaces healthy, maintainers/moderators may:
- Ask participants to pause a discussion (“cool-down”)
- Redirect off-topic debates
- Lock threads that become unproductive or unsafe
- Remove content that violates this Code of Conduct, even if “borderline,” to protect community safety
